-DS visited set,priority_queue<pair>,unordered_map
-insert the pair of -1 ,src in the priority_queue
-one  by one remove the root element of the priority_queue
-if the root element is already visited than continue;
-we store the wt of the pair in the ans
-update the mapping
-- go the every neighbour of the current element and only add those which are non visited and have a better wt proposition.
priority_queue->(wt,node);//node represent the parent or src
-- map=> (node,wt); while here node represent the neighbour of src for the updation
